URL Shortify is a simple web app that lets you create and manage short links locally in your browser. 
You can use it to create memorable short aliases for long URLs, quickly access your 
favorite sites, or share shortened links with others. All data stays on your device—no backend,
no registration.

How to use:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern browser.
3. Enter an alias (e.g. "yt") and a long URL (e.g. "https://youtube.com") and click Add.
4. Click the alias or copy the short link to open or share it.
5. You can edit or delete links anytime.
6. All links are saved locally in your browser.
7. Switch between dark and light themes with the top button.

If you open the app with a hash (e.g. index.html#yt), it will automatically redirect to the saved URL if the alias exists.

A handy tool for local, private link management—no external services required.
